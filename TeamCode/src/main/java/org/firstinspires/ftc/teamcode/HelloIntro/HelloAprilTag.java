/*
 * This OpMode illustrates using a camera to locate and drive towards a specific AprilTag.
 * The code assumes a Holonomic (Mecanum or X Drive) Robot.
 *
 * The drive goal is to rotate to keep the Tag centered in the camera, while strafing to be directly in front of the tag, and
 * driving towards the tag to achieve the desired distance.
 * To reduce any motion blur (which will interrupt the detection process) the Camera exposure is reduced to a very low value (5mS)
 * You can determine the best Exposure and Gain values by using the ConceptAprilTagOptimizeExposure OpMode in this Samples folder.
 *
 * The code assumes a Robot Configuration with motors named: leftfront_drive and rightfront_drive, leftback_drive and rightback_drive.
 * The motor directions must be set so a positive power goes forward on all wheels.
 * This sample assumes that the current game AprilTag Library (usually for the current season) is being loaded by default,
 * so you should choose to approach a valid tag ID (usually starting at 0)
 *
 * Under manual control, the left stick will move forward/back & left/right.  The right stick will rotate the robot.
 * Manually drive the robot until it displays Target data on the Driver Station.
 *
 * Press and hold the *Left Bumper* to enable the automatic "Drive to target" mode.
 * Release the Left Bumper to return to manual driving mode.
 *
 * Under "Drive To Target" mode, the robot has three goals:
 * 1) Turn the robot to always keep the Tag centered on the camera frame. (Use the Target Bearing to turn the robot.)
 * 2) Strafe the robot towards the centerline of the Tag, so it approaches directly in front  of the tag.  (Use the Target Yaw to strafe the robot)
 * 3) Drive towards the Tag to get to the desired distance.  (Use Tag Range to drive the robot forward/backward)
 *
 * Use DESIRED_DISTANCE to set how close you want the robot to get to the target.
 * Speed and Turn sensitivity can be adjusted using the SPEED_GAIN, STRAFE_GAIN and TURN_GAIN constants.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into the TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode folder.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
